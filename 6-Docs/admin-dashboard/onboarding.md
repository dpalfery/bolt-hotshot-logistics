# Admin dashboard onboarding

## Dependencies

- Node.js 20+
- npm (lockfile is `package-lock.json`)
- A running API (see [API onboarding](../api/onboarding.md))

## Setup

1. `cd 1-Presentation/admin-dashboard`
2. `npm install`
3. Set Azure AD public identifiers in the **process environment** (not files committed to the repo):

```bash
export NEXT_PUBLIC_AZURE_CLIENT_ID="<app-registration-client-id>"
export NEXT_PUBLIC_AZURE_TENANT_ID="<tenant-id>"
```

`npm run dev` and `npm run build` run `scripts/generate-env.js`, which writes a local `.env.local` from those variables. That generated file must stay gitignored and must never be added to the tree.

4. `npm run dev` — Next.js with `--experimental-https`. Open the URL printed by the dev server (typically https://localhost:3000).

## Debug path

- Auth is MSAL (`@azure/msal-browser` / `@azure/msal-react`).
- API calls go through `src/services/api.ts`.
- Real-time updates use `@microsoft/signalr`.
- Playwright: `npm test` (installs browsers via `pretest`).

## Non-standard operating procedures

- Do not commit `.env`, `.env.local`, or Azure AD secrets.
- The dashboard is not hosted on Vercel in this repository; Azure deployment is Terraform under `7-Deployment/`.
