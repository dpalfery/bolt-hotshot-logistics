# Security Configuration Examples

This directory contains example security configurations that can be implemented in the Hotshot Logistics application.

## Quick Start Security Implementation

Follow these examples to implement basic security measures quickly:

1. **Authentication**: See `authentication-example.cs` for JWT authentication setup
2. **Input Validation**: See `validation-examples.cs` for DTO validation patterns
3. **Security Headers**: See `security-headers-example.cs` for middleware setup
4. **Infrastructure**: See `terraform-security-example.tf` for secure Azure deployment
5. **Rate Limiting**: See `rate-limiting-example.cs` for API throttling

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Immediate - 1-2 weeks)
1. Input validation on all controllers
2. Basic authentication middleware
3. Security headers
4. HTTPS enforcement

### Phase 2 (2-4 weeks)
1. Comprehensive authorization
2. Rate limiting
3. Infrastructure security hardening
4. Secure logging

### Phase 3 (1-2 months)
1. Advanced monitoring
2. Security testing automation
3. Compliance auditing

## Testing Security Changes

Before implementing any security changes:
1. Test in development environment first
2. Verify existing functionality still works
3. Run security tests
4. Review with security team
